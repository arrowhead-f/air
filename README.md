# Arrowhead user Interface Representation (AIR)

This repository organizes the work being done to select or produce a format for visually representing Arrowhead services.

The purpose of AIR is to allow for graphical user interfaces to be described for individual Arrowhead services.
These user interface descriptions are meant to be visualized through systems able to both interpret the descriptions and access a service possible to visualize with them.

The work currently being done on AIR are presented in the following documents:
